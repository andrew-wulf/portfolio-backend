# Welcome!

## This is the backend API for my portfolio page, created with ruby on rails.
At the moment there are two projects which will utilize this backend, the main one being my twitter clone, 
and the second being Movie Battle, a multiplayer game I'm working on. This is to reduce the number of separate services I have up and running,
and 99% of the actual database usage comes from my twitter app.

So, for all intents and purposes, view this as my Twitter API!
